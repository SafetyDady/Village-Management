## JWT Authentication Implementation

**Deployment Date:** [To be scheduled]  
**Project Owner:** SafetyDady  
**System:** Village Management System with JWT Authentication  
**Priority:** Village Accounting System (Phase 1)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

This Go-Live Plan outlines the final steps for deploying the Village Management System with complete JWT Authentication to production. The system has achieved **100% test coverage** (60/60 tests passing) and is production-ready.

### **Deployment Strategy**

Based on the system architecture and requirements:

1. **Backend API** â†’ Deploy to **Railway** (smart-village-management-api)
2. **Admin Frontend** â†’ Deploy to **Vercel** (smart-village-admin-dashboard)
3. **Database** â†’ PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean (existing)
4. **Priority Focus** â†’ Village Accounting System for initial deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Village Accounting System Deployment

### **Step 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation (Day -1)**

#### **1.1 Environment Setup**
```bash
# Generate production JWT secret
python -c "import os; print('JWT_SECRET_KEY=' + os.urandom(32).hex())"

# Generate Flask secret key
python -c "import os; print('FLASK_SECRET_KEY=' + os.urandom(24).hex())"
```

#### **1.2 Railway Backend Deployment**
1. **Create Railway Project**
   - Connect GitHub repository: `https://github.com/SafetyDady/Village-Management`
   - Select branch: `feature/flask-jwt-auth`
   - Set root directory: `backend/`

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```env
   # Database (DigitalOcean PostgreSQL)
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=require
   DB_HOST=your-digitalocean-db-host
   DB_PORT=25060
   DB_NAME=village_management_prod
   DB_USER=your-db-user
   DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
   
   # JWT Configuration
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=[generated-jwt-secret]
   JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES=3600
   JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES=2592000
   
   # Flask Configuration
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=[generated-flask-secret]
   FLASK_ENV=production
   FLASK_DEBUG=False
   
   # CORS (will be updated with Vercel domain)
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
   
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=8000
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   ```

3. **Deploy Backend**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Monitor deployment logs
   - Verify health endpoint: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health`

#### **1.3 Vercel Frontend Deployment**
1. **Create Vercel Project**
   - Connect GitHub repository: `https://github.com/SafetyDady/Village-Management`
   - Select branch: `feature/flask-jwt-auth`
   - Set root directory: `admin-dashboard/`

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "npm run build",
     "outputDirectory": "dist",
     "installCommand": "npm install"
   }
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
   ```

4. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy
   - Verify deployment: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app`

### **Step 2: Deployment Day (Day 0)**

#### **2.1 Final Verification (Morning)**
- [ ] **Backend Health Check**
  ```bash
  curl -f https://your-railway-app.railway.app/health
  ```
- [ ] **Frontend Accessibility**
  ```bash
  curl -f https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
  ```
- [ ] **Database Connectivity**
  ```bash
  # Test from Railway backend logs
  ```

#### **2.2 Authentication System Testing (Afternoon)**
- [ ] **User Registration Test**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/auth/register \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"admin@village.com","password":"AdminPass123","full_name":"Village Admin","role":"VILLAGE_ADMIN"}'
  ```

- [ ] **User Login Test**
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://your-railway-app.railway.app/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"admin@village.com","password":"AdminPass123"}'
  ```

- [ ] **Protected Endpoint Test**
  ```bash
  # Use token from login response
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://your-railway-app.railway.app/auth/me
  ```

#### **2.3 Business Logic Testing**
- [ ] **User Management API**
  ```bash
  # Test with admin token
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/v1/users
  ```

- [ ] **RBAC Verification**
